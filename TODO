Battery time remaining estimation:
	If /tmp/status.bat doesn't exist && battery is discharging
		write to it with "%d %d", date, battery_charge
	Else if /tmp/status exists && battery !discharging
		delete it

	If battery is discharging, read /tmp/status.bat and work out time remaining
	as charge_delta / time_delta * charge_remaining

Change to setting xroot ourselves to eliminate all of this state in /tmp?
